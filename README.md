## Building the image using the recipe

### To build the image locally
Run the script `build.sh` to build image locally.

```
bash ./build.sh
```

### To build the image remotely remotely
Run the script `rbuild.sh` to build image remotely.

```
bash ./rbuild.sh
```

You will need to edit the script above to match your account on [SyLabs.io](https://sylabs.io/).

### Pulling from the repository
If you have the client installed and cannot build the image locally nor remotely, simply run

```
singularity pull --arch amd64 library://icaoberg/default/bedtools:v2.29.2
```
